<h1>Sarah Battram-Cake</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  I started my adult life as a healthcare assistant, circled around a few
  different careers, had a few children but circled back to my beloved NHS to
  work within 111. I believe the NHS is the greatest institution in our country,
  of which I am proud to be a small cog. Working in the NHS has filled me with
  the desire to help people but also ensure that we are helping all people.
</p>
<p>
  Alongside my auditing role I have an intense interest in disability inclusion,
  particularly non visible disabilities and neurodivergence. I have been
  involved with disability representation through UNISON but also through the
  internal staff networks. This is also reflected in my position as SEN Governor
  for a local infant school. We have a wealth of amazing people who are excluded
  from making a social impact through exclusionary practices or environments.
  Small changes can make huge impacts and benefit us all.
